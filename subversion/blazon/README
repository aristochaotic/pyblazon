SET-UP
------
This software requires the following:
- Python
- the Python base library
- SVGDraw
- PLY

In Debian, PLY is packaged as python-ply (still only in unstable). It
is also available from http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ .
SVGDraw is not packaged yet as far as we know, but it is available at
http://www2.sfk.nl/svg .

Usage:
   python gen.py <blazon>

Example:
   python gen.py Vert a saltire argent.

Though, to actually view the shield, you need to save the SVG output
with redirection, e.g.:

   python gen.py Vert a saltire argent. > test.svg

Or pipe it into a viewer, such as:

   python gen.py Vert a saltire argent. | rsvg-view --stdin

If you are unfamiliar with blazonry, the Wikipedia article
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazon is a good starting point. Some
examples of blazons that are currently supported can be found in
blazons-good.txt in the tests/ subdirectory.

FOR DEVELOPERS
--------------
If you want to run the regression tests, you also need the following
components:

- xml.parsers.xmlproc library, which is a part of PyXML. In Debian,
  install the python-xml package.
- PIL (Python Imaging Library). In Debian, install the python-imaging package.

To run the regression tests, do:
   python regressiontest.py

It should output a lot of stuff, but end with OK. If it ends with
FAILED, you need to figure out if the production code or the test code
is wrong, and fix accordingly.

An easy way of adding a new gold standard shield is to add the blazon
at the end of gsblazons.txt, but prepended by an existing image file
(which of course will give a bogus result). For instance:

   1.png Azure semy-de-lis or.

When you run the test suite again, you will get an error (because the
new image looks nothing at all like 1.png). But do not despair! Simply
copy the newly generated tests/gsshields/out.png to an unused
filename, and updated gsblazons.txt accordingly, and rerun. There
should be no test failures this time.
