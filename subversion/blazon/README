SET-UP
------
This software requires the following:
- Python
- the Python base library
- SVGDraw
- YAPPS

YAPPS is available as the Debian package yapps2. SVGDraw is not
packaged yet as far as we know, but it is available at
http://www2.sfk.nl/svg .

When you have installed all of the above, run "make". This will
generate parse.py from parse.yap.

Usage:
   python blazon.py <blazon>

Example:
   python blazon.py Vert a saltire argent.

Though, to actually view the shield, you need to save the SVG output
with redirection, e.g.:

   python blazon.py Vert a saltire argent. > test.svg

Or pipe it into a viewer, such as:

   python blazon.py Vert a saltire argent. | rsvg-view --stdin

If you are unfamiliar with blazonry, the Wikipedia article
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazon is a good starting point. Some
examples of blazons that are currently supported can be found in
blazons-good.txt in the tests/ subdirectory.

FOR DEVELOPERS
--------------
If you want to run the regression tests, you also need the
xml.parsers.xmlproc library, which is a part of PyXML. In Debian,
install the python-xml package.

To run the regression tests, do:
   python regressiontest.py

It should output a lot of stuff, but end with OK. If it ends with
FAILED, you need to figure out if the production code or the test code
is wrong, and fix accordingly.
