To set-up, run "make clean", then "make". Make is supposed to know
when parse.py is older than parse.yap, but apparently it does
not. Oops.

Usage:
   python blazon.py <blazon>

Example:
   python blazon.py Vert a saltire argent. > test.svg

Examine the output SVG file, for example in Firefox.

To run the regression tests, do:
   python regressiontest.py

It should output a lot of stuff, but end with OK. If it ends with
FAILED, you need to figure out if the production code or the test code
is wrong, and fix accordingly.
