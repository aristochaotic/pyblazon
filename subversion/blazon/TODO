Vital:
- support all tinctures, even the unusual ones
- support all charges that are simple, geometrical figures
- a charge or a group "between" a group
- charges upon ordinaries
- charges to end up in the conventional places according to divisions of the
  field. E.g. two annulets on a field parted per bend is supposed to go in
  the sinister chief and dexter base, not (by default) per fess.

Fairly important:
- countercharging
- semy of any single charge
- importing charges from file or database (it would get tedious to specify
  the outline of, say, a lion, in the source code itself)
- back-references ("of the first", "as many")
- define the tincture of multiple charges at the same time
  ("a foo and a bar argent")
- possible to specify each quarter in a quartered shield individually
- thin black lines between everything (or at least the option of having it)

Wishlist:
- semy of _anything_ (even crazy, complex things like "a
  cross-crosslet or between four bezants"
- multilingual support (e.g. blazons in French, German, Norwegian ...)
- marshalling
- support for other shield shapes
- support for using a flag instead of a shield
