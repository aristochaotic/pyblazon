Prerequisites for Initial Rollout:
(from arj letter 27 X 06)
- Charges:
  - Canton (DONE)
  - Orle
  - Tressure
  - Gyron (DONE)
  - Flaunches (SORTA DONE)
  - Fret (DONE)
  - Baton
  - Mascle (DONE)
  - Fusil (DONE)

  - Masoned (DONE)

- Line Types:
  - Urdy
  - Nebuly

- Other Features:

Vital:
- support all charges that are simple, geometrical figures
- a charge or a group "between" a group
- charges upon ordinaries (GETTING THERE)
- charges to end up in the conventional places according to divisions of the
  field. E.g. two annulets on a field parted per bend is supposed to go in
  the sinister chief and dexter base, not (by default) per fess. (GETTING THERE)

Fairly important:
- semy of any single charge (PRETTY MUCH DONE)
- importing charges from file or database (it would get tedious to specify
  the outline of, say, a lion, in the source code itself) (GETTING THERE)
  - Going to need some more powerful equipment for more general case.
- back-references ("of the first" (DONE, BUT NOT WORKING ATM), "as many")
- possible to specify each quarter in a quartered shield individually
- thin black lines between everything (or at least the option of having it)
- Implemented special case with "a fesse embattled", and also implement
  counter-embattled
- Compony (I have my doubts about this one --mes)


Wishlist:
- semy of _anything_ (even crazy, complex things like "a
  cross-crosslet or between four bezants"
- multilingual support (e.g. blazons in French, German, Norwegian ...)
- marshalling
- support for other shield shapes
- support for using a flag instead of a shield

Freshmeat/Sourceforge to check for collisions.
